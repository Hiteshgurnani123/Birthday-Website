Please create the **fourth page** of my animated birthday website. Here are the full updated details and corrections:

🌄 1. Background Image:
- Use the most recently uploaded image as the **background** for this page.
- It should cover the entire screen (center, no repeat, cover).
- Slight opacity can be added if needed for better readability of game elements.
- All UI elements like borders or outlines must match the background’s dreamy, Studio Ghibli-inspired theme.

🎵 2. Background Music:
- Use the **same music file** as previous pages (uploaded earlier).
- It should **auto-play and loop continuously** in the background without interruption.

🖱️ 3. Cursor Movement Effect:
- Retain the **cursor sparkle/magical trail effect** from the earlier pages for consistency.

🎮 4. Main Feature: 🎉 **Digital Birthday Hunt Game**
- Create a fun hidden-object game where Tamnna has to find a few birthday-themed items on the page (e.g., cake slice, gift box, balloon, cupcake, star).
- The background should feel like part of the game — subtly hiding objects in plain sight.
- When a user clicks an object:
   - It should animate (e.g., bounce, glow).
   - Maybe give a small sound or visual reward (optional).
- Display a message like “You found 1/5 items!” and update as progress increases.
- When all items are found, show a sweet congratulatory message like:
   - “Yay! You’ve found all the birthday surprises! 🎉”
   - Add a "Next" button after that for page navigation.

🎯 Hidden items should be:
- Styled to match the page aesthetic — soft, glowing outlines or shadows.
- Not too obvious, but also not frustratingly hard.
- Ideally 4-6 small themed objects.

🔁 5. Previous Fixes:
- On the **first page**, center the navigation button horizontally and move it a little upward (so it's not touching the very bottom).
- On the **third page**, remove the extra button labeled **“choose a gift for your birthday”** — it’s not needed on that page.

➡️ 6. Navigation:
- After the game is completed, show a button labeled **“Next”** to move to the fifth page.
- The button should be styled in a magical way, with gentle animation or glow on hover.

🔤 7. Style:
- Maintain the same dreamy style — clean fonts, animated elements, Studio Ghibli-inspired vibe.
- Font family should remain consistent (like "Quicksand" or similar).
- Borders or outlines should harmonize with the background image.

🎯 Goal:
This page should feel fun and magical — like a sweet little adventure surprise for Tamnna, giving her a moment of joy while finding birthday-themed hidden treasures.
