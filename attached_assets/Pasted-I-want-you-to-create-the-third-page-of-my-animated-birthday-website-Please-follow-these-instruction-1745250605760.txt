I want you to create the third page of my animated birthday website. Please follow these instructions carefully:

🌌 1. **Background Image:**
Use the most recently uploaded image as the full-screen background for this third page. It should:
- Cover the entire page (no repeat, center, cover).
- Feel dreamy and soft, just like Studio Ghibli-style aesthetics.
- Adjust opacity slightly if needed to ensure UI elements like the game are clearly visible.

🎮 2. **Feature: Memory Match Game**
This page should include a fun memory card matching game with the following properties:
- Display 12 cards (6 pairs) arranged in a responsive grid layout.
- Each card should flip on click and reveal a cute icon or pattern that matches the dreamy background style.
- Use a soft flip animation with a slight bounce or glow when a match is found.
- Include a light score tracker and a reset button.
- Once all matches are found, display a cute success message like “You’ve unlocked the magic memory!”

🎵 3. **Background Music:**
Use the newly uploaded music file as background music for this page. It should:
- Autoplay when the page loads.
- Be set on **loop**.
- Be subtle and light to maintain focus on the game without being distracting.

🔁 4. **Update Second Page Button:**
Go back to the second page and:
- Update the button that navigates to this third page.
- The new label should be: **“Now it’s time to play a game”**
- Keep the button styling smooth with a hover effect, and make sure it fits the background and dreamy aesthetic of that page.

💡 5. **Theme Consistency:**
Make sure the entire third page matches the look and feel of the rest of the site:
- Use rounded corners, soft shadows, and pastel tones.
- Ensure all fonts are clean and legible, preferably something whimsical like Google Fonts' "Quicksand" or "Poppins".
- Cursor should remain custom if added on previous pages.

This page should look visually magical, feel interactive and playful, and match the fantasy theme of the uploaded background image.
